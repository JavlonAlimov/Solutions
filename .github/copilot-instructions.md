# AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
This repository, `Solutions`, appears to be a collection of solutions, potentially for coding challenges or algorithmic problems. The structure currently includes a `LeetCode/` directory, which suggests a focus on LeetCode problem-solving.

## Key Directories
- **`LeetCode/`**: This directory likely contains solutions to LeetCode problems. The exact structure and naming conventions within this directory are not yet clear.

## Development Conventions
- Follow standard coding practices for algorithmic problem-solving, such as clear function names, inline comments for complex logic, and efficient algorithms.
- Use descriptive filenames that match the problem name or ID for easy identification.

## Suggested Workflow
1. **Adding a New Solution**:
   - Create a new file in the appropriate directory (e.g., `LeetCode/`) with a descriptive name.
   - Include a comment at the top of the file with the problem description and a link to the problem statement if available.
2. **Testing**:
   - Ensure that the solution is tested against multiple edge cases.
   - If a testing framework is used, include test cases in a separate file or within the solution file.

## Notes for AI Agents
- When generating new solutions, ensure that the code is optimized for readability and performance.
- If the problem description is available, include it as a comment at the top of the solution file.
- Maintain consistency in code style across all files.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a detailed `README.md` for the `LeetCode/` directory to describe its structure and conventions.
- Include a testing framework or guidelines for verifying solutions.
